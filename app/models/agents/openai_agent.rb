    description <<-MD
      The OpenAi Agent interacts with OpenAI Chat Completion API.

      The `model` used, multiple available including 'gpt-3.5-turbo', 'gpt-3.5-turbo-16k', 'gpt-4', etc.

      The `instructions` gives the system a prompt.

      The `input` is the user-defined message, in this context the agent can receive input from events like {{ message }}.

      The `temperature` controls randomness of answer, between 0 and 2 with default between 0.7 and 1. Lower is more deterministic and higher gives more random outputs.

      The `max_tokens` is the number of tokens to generate in the completion, default at 64. Prompt tokens + max_tokens cannot exceed model's context window (usually 2048).

      The `top_p` determines the portion of highest probability tokens to select from; similar to temp with bounds 0 to 2, lower more deterministic and higher more random.

      `examples` of useful prompts are below...

Another style involves carving or incising designs and selectively polishing the raised areas. For generations several families from Kha'\''po Owingeh and P'\''ohwh√≥ge Owingeh pueblos have been making black-on-black ware with the techniques passed down from matriarch potters. Artists from other pueblos have also produced black-on-black ware. Several contemporary artists have created works honoring the pottery of their ancestors."

Overall, I found the airbed to be a mixed bag with some positives and negatives.\n    \n    Starting with the positives, the Inflatotron 2000 is incredibly easy to set up and inflate. It comes with a built-in electric pump that quickly inflates the bed within a few minutes, which is a huge plus for anyone who wants to avoid the hassle of manually pumping up their airbed. The bed is also quite comfortable to sleep on and offers decent support for your back, which is a major plus if you have any issues with back pain.\n    \n    On the other hand, I did experience some negatives with the Inflatotron 2000. Firstly, I found that the airbed is not very durable and punctures easily. During my camping trip, the bed got punctured by a stray twig that had fallen on it, which was quite frustrating. Secondly, I noticed that the airbed tends to lose air overnight, which meant that I had to constantly re-inflate it every morning. This was a bit annoying as it disrupted my sleep and made me feel less rested in the morning.\n    \n    Another negative point is that the Inflatotron 2000 is quite heavy and bulky, which makes it difficult to transport and store. If you'\''re planning on using this airbed for camping or other outdoor activities, you'\''ll need to have a large enough vehicle to transport it and a decent amount of storage space to store it when not in use."
